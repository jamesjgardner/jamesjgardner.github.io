Experience

Apple Inc. Data Mining Scientist
April 2013 - Current

Digital Reasoning Systems, Inc. Director of Advanced Technology / Senior Scientist 
May 2010 - April 2013
Lead a team of scientists and analysts to provide scientiﬁc, engineering, technical, and analytical support for a wide range of research efforts.
Researched and recommended machine learning algorithms and data sets for advancing the techniques for "entity resolution" (Named Entity Recognition, within-document coreference, cross-document coreference, assertion and fact detection, etc.) and ported them to Hadoop Map/Reduce to achieve web scale analysis on commodity hardware.
Obtained a Department of Defense Top Secret/SCI Security Clearance (Inactive after leaving company)

Center for Comprehensive Informatics, Emory University. Student Programmer. 
January 2010 - May 2010
Created web-based GUI in Django and ported HIDE project to Python from Perl to allow users to tag Personal Health Information, train extraction models, and perform experiments for PHI detection.
• Integrated HIDE into caTIES and caBIG frameworks. 

Emory University. Research/Teaching Assistant.
August 2005 - May 2010
• Performed research on privacy and natural language processing. 
• Taught discrete mathematics and aided in grading multiple courses.
• Developed NNexus and HIDE.

Consultant.
June 2006 - May 2010
Developed an automatic hyperlinking system (NNexus) and enhanced the PlanetMath.org server software (Noosphere).
Built StatProb.com for Springer based on PlanetMath.org codebase.
Participated in Google Summer of Code Program during summers of 2006, 2007 and 2008
